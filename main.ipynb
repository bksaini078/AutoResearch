      "Action Input: \"multimodal AI explanation\"\u001b[0m\u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mMultimodal AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can process, understand and/or generate outputs for more than one type of data. Modality refers to the way in which something exists, is experienced, or is expressed. In the context of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence, modality specifically refers to a data type. A multimodal AI system actually consists of many unimodal neural networks. These make up the input module, which receives multiple data types. Then there's the fusion module, which combines, aligns, and processes the data from each modality. Fusion employs various techniques, such as early fusion (concatenating raw data). Multimodal AI models are advanced AI systems capable of understanding and generating information from multiple data modalities or sources, such as text, images, audio, and video. Unlike traditional AI models, which are limited to processing only one type of data, multimodal models can analyze and generate insights from various data types ... The term \"multimodal\" refers to an AI's ability to function in multiple modes, including text, images, and sounds. Although Altman did not explicitly confirm that GPT-4 would be multimodal in that time, he did suggest that such technology is on the horizon and will arrive in the near future. Understanding Multimodal AI. In the world of artificial intelligence, multimodal AI is an emerging concept gaining traction due to its ability to analyze and interpret data from multiple sources.Multimodal AI takes advantage of its advantage of its unique characteristics and methods that traditional unimodal AI lacks.In this section, we will provide an in-depth definition of multimodal AI and ...\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mFinal Answer: Multimodal AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can process, understand, and generate outputs for more than one type of data.
